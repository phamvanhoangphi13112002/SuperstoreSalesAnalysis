# Superstore Sales Analysis Project

This project is focused on Superstore Sales Analysis, involving various data processing and analysis steps. Here's an overview of the process:

## Process Overview

1. **Data Cleaning in Google Colab**
   
2. **ETL Data by SSIS**

3. **Fact 1: Analysis of the Store's Overall YTD Business Situation and Sale Metrics (Using Power BI)**

4. **Fact 2: RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis (Using Power BI)**

5. **Fact 3: Customer Cohort Analysis (Using SQL & Tableau)**

6. **Fact 4: Forecasting Sales for Superstore (Using Tableau)**

7. **Returned Goods Prediction (Using Python and Machine Learning)**
   
   Implementation Process:
   
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
   - Feature Selection: Categorical, Numerical, and Target Features
   
   - Outlier Detection and Transformation for Numerical Features
   
   - Encoding for Categorical Features
   
   - Train-Test Split
   
   - Upsampling with SMOTE
   
   - Min-Max Scaling for Numerical Features
   
   - Training Model: Utilized XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier
   
   - Model Evaluation
   
   - Model Saving
